# swex-rune-v2
updated plugin from https://github.com/cooye/RuneDropEfficiency2/releases


reminder:

# RuneDropEfficiency2
Updated Rune Drop efficiency tool. Toggle feature to show all upgrades even fails. This can allow you to view efficiency and max hero/legend grinded efficiency for any non +15 rune by simply upgrading once. 

Happy rune purging!

Add the release .asar file to your SWEX \plugins folder and watch artifact efficiencies as they drop for quick comparison. Follows the efficiency math from SWOP and SWGT.

Thanks to Xzandro for the original runedropefficiency code and math.

Top 3 (and ties) for gemmed efficiency are highlighted. Note: ungrindable stats will never achieve as high as a possible efficiency as grindable stats yet they are still very important. Don't simply gem for efficiency alone. This is just a tool to see potentials for a given rune easily.
